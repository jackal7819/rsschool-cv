			<h1>Curriculum vitae</h1>
			<p>
				In general usage in all English-speaking countries, a CV is
				short (usually a maximum of two sides of A4 paper), and
				therefore contains only a summary of the job seeker's employment
				history, qualifications, education, and some personal
				information. Such a short CV is often also called a resume only
				in North America, where it is however also often called a CV
				outside academia. CVs are often tailored to change the
				emphasis of the information according to the particular position
				for which the job seeker is applying.
